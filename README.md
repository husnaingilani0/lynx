# lynx

Is a privacy based alternative to google workspace. Hosted in germany. Here is the source code: https://github.com/nextcloud/server
It is the same exact code as nextcloud so the question is why not just self host?

You can, if your a tech nerd.
But for most people self hosting just isn't it. It's a lot of hassle, not that secure. If you run it on a local machine then you can't access it outside your lan (Unless your a tech nerd and know how to). If you host it on a hosting/server, its still a hassle, and if you get it setup you still have to install the apps. And then the documents server, don't forget making your email server, encrypting it, UHHH...! Long story short it's just an enormous hassle (Personal Experience & a Fact).

That's why lynx came into existence, to make privacy, affordable and avaliable to everybody without giving up any convinience, breaking the bank or having the hassle of setting up & maintaining your own server not knowing when it's gonna get hacked or when it's gonna break and your ganna lose all your memories. 

Can't i use google? I think we all know how PRIVACY FREINDLY google is. Training there AI ðŸ˜ˆ on my babies photos. NEVER! Not For Me (or for you).

We are improving day by day, we are'nt the best yet, but that's what mission 2028 is for ðŸ˜œ. We're building a community along the way and we're here for the long run. So buckle up and get ready. Learn More: https://analyticscamp.org
