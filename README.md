# lynx

Is a privacy based alternative to google workspace. Hosted in germany. Here is the source code: https://github.com/nextcloud/server
It is the same exact code as nextcloud so the question is why not just self host?
   You can if your a tech nerd. But for most people self hosting just isn't it. It's a lot of hassle, not that secure. If you run it on a local machine then you cant access it outside your lan (Unless your a     tech nerd). If you host it on a hosting/server, its still a hassle, and if you get it setup you still have to install the apps. And then the documents server, don't forget making your email server, encrypting it, UHHH...! Long story short it's just a hassle. That's why lynx came into existence, to make privacy, affordable and avalible to everybody, without giving up any convinience. We are improving day by day, we are'nt the best yet, that's what mission 2028 is for ðŸ˜œ. We're building a community along the way and we're here for the long run. So buckle up and get ready.
